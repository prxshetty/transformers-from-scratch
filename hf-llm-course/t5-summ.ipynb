A lease shall provide that any property subsequently leased by a joint powers authority for which a lease or rental for a period of five years or more is contemplated, shall be advertised and awarded utilizing for the purpose the same procedure followed by the director for other state properties. The director’s authority to lease real property under this section shall include, but not be limited to, the authority to lease portions of buildings and facilities occupied or to be occupied in part by state agencies, to private parties, and other public agencies for office, residential, parking, and commercial uses consistent with the Capitol Area Plan.\\n(b)(1)The director may sell real property that is owned by the state within the Capitol Area Plan area that is not under the jurisdiction of any other state agency and that is designated for residential and commercial purposes in the 1997 update of the plan. If the director sells property under this section, that property shall be sold at its fair market value to the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 for resale and use in the development of residential and commercial properties consistent with the Capitol Area Plan. In addition, any property sold under this section shall not diminish the number of existing dwelling units or subsequently developed units that are required to be made available to low-income households pursuant to Section 8193. For the purposes of Section 8193, an existing residential dwelling unit or a subsequently developed unit located on land sold pursuant to this section shall continue to be included in the determination of the total number of dwelling units located on property leased by the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4.\\n(2)The director shall not sell any existing residential properties pursuant to this subdivision that are under the management of the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 unless that sale is part of an overall development plan that will lead to a net increase in residential units on the affected site or sites.\\n(3)In addition, the director shall not sell any existing residential properties pursuant to this subdivision that are under the management of the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 unless a deed restriction is recorded against the properties that contains an express condition and covenant that the real property conveyed shall be used only for residential purposes for a period of at least 45 years. “Residential purposes” means the same or substantially similar multifamily, single-family, or condominium use, or a mixed use, with the same or greater number of residential units on the affected site. The terms of the restriction are for the benefit of the public at large and for the benefit of all parcels of land located within the boundaries of the Capitol Area Plan. The residential use required by this subdivision shall bind all successive owners of the property for a period of 45 years from the date the property is conveyed by the joint powers authority.\\n(c)With respect to residential leases, the director’s authority included in this section shall not extend beyond the Capitol area. The director shall ensure that tenants residing within the Capitol area are not involuntarily displaced as a result of leases executed after January 1, 1978. The director’s authority shall also include the authority to enter into long-term leases not to exceed 60 years and to pledge, subordinate, hypothecate, or to permit the assignment of these leases in connection with financing to be obtained by any lessee or sublessee.\\n(d)The director shall not execute a sales agreement or lease agreement for a term lease of more than five years between the state and another entity, enter into a joint powers agreement, or issue revenue bonds or notes of evidences of indebtedness offered by the joint powers authority, if the agreement concerns state-owned property in the County of Sacramento or the County of Yolo, unless not less than 30 days prior to its execution he or she notifies and provides an economic analysis of the proposed sale to the Members of the Legislature who represent the Capitol area and the chairman of the committee in each house of the Legislature that considers appropriations, the chairman of the appropriate policy committee in each house, and the Chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or his or her designee, in writing of his or her intention to execute such an agreement. The chairman of the committee or his or her designee may determine a lesser notification period prior to execution. The director shall provide a copy of the notice to any person who requests the director in writing for the notice.\\n(e)The Legislature hereby finds that it will be of broad public benefit to stimulate development of residential and commercial components of the Capitol Area Plan. Therefore, the director may sell property to the joint powers authority created pursuant to Section 8169.4 at a price that is determined to be its fair market value and terms that have been determined to be appropriate to stimulate timely development to meet the goals set forth by the Legislature in the 1997 update of the Capitol Area Plan. The Capitol Area Development Authority may request these sales after providing the director with appropriate economic analysis in support of the value at which property is to be conveyed. The director may approve the sale of the property if he or she concurs with the economic analysis.\\n(f)The Legislature hereby finds that it will be of broad public benefit to lease some residential units in the Capitol area to persons and families of low or moderate income, as defined by Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code, for less than prevailing market rental rates. Therefore, the director may rent or provide for the rental of residential facilities to persons and families of low or moderate income for less than market rental rates and enter into long-term ground leases at nominal or below market rental rates when the director deems it will benefit these persons and families.\\n(g)All leases of state-owned property in the core area to any private person for other than parking shall be subject to possessory interest taxes in accordance with Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 101) of Part 1 of Division 1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\\n(h)The net proceeds of any moneys received from the disposition of any state parcels sold pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be deposited into the General Fund.
